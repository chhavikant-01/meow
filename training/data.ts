{
    'Query': What is interest, and how does it work?
    'Response': Interest is the cost of borrowing money or the reward for saving money. If you borrow, you'll pay interest
    to the lender. If you save, you'll earn interest from the bank. For example, if you take
    a loan of $1,000 with a 5% annual interest rate, you'll pay $50 as interest in one
    year.
}
{
    'Query': What is a credit score, and why is it important?
    'Response': A credit score is a number that shows how reliable you are at repaying borrowed money. It
    helps lenders decide whether to give you loans and at what interest rate. A high
    score means you're likely to repay on time, while a low score may make borrowing
    harder or more expensive.
}
{
    'Query': What is compound interest, and how is it different from simple interest?
    'Response': Compound interest is calculated on both the initial amount (principal) and the interest already earned. Simple interest is only
    calculated on the principal. Example: Simple Interest: On $1,000 at 5% for 2 years,
    you earn $50/year = $100 total. Compound Interest: On $1,000 at 5%, you earn $50
    in the first year and $52.50 in the second year (interest on interest), totaling
    $102.50.
